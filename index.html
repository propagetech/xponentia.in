        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Xponentia was set up to address the paucity of capital in the Indian mid-market corporate sector. Inspite of having dynamic and enterprising entrepreneurs who are building world class businesses, this segment
          of
          the Indian market has traditionally been faced with a dearth of capital providers – both debt and equity.</p>

        <p>Moreover, at this stage of their life-cycle, in addition to capital, companies need to "corporatize" their business in order to scale up - they need to strengthen functional capabilities in finance, marketing,
          IT and HR as well as improve corporate governance practices, important elements for long-term sustainable growth. Xponentia aims to be a value added partner who can catalyse sustainable growth by providing
          capabilities & capital to our portfolio companies.</p>

        <p>Leveraging decades of investing experience, Xponentia has developed a unique Value Creation Strategy that provides a compelling value proposition to our portfolio companies with demonstrated results.</p>

        <p>With a successful track record of investing over $1billion of capital, Xponentia's Founders have a long and successful history in the Indian market for over three decades, and previously led the investment
          teams of The Carlyle Group and Citigroup Venture Capital International (CVCI) & HSBC Private Equity.</p>

        <p>Xponentia has assembled a Team of Investment Professionals with extensive industry experience at marquee firms such as Oman-India Joint Investment Fund, Rabo Private Equity, Edelweiss, SAIF Partners, Deloitte
          and Motilal Oswal, and retained the services of Operating Advisors/Management Consultants - seasoned functional specialists in Strategy, Finance, Marketing, HR and IT - who work actively with our
          entrepreneurs/management teams and assist them into transforming their businesses into world class enterprises.</p>

        <p>Across Xponentia Opportunities Fund-1 and Xponentia Opportunities Fund-2, the firm now manages ~$200 million of investor capital.</p>
