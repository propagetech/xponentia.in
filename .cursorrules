# Cursor Rules for Xponentia Website

## Project Overview
This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website for Xponentia Capital Partners LLP. The project uses vanilla JavaScript, semantic HTML, and CSS with custom properties.

## Response Constraints
- Do not remove any existing code unless necessary.
- Do not remove comments or commented-out code unless necessary.
- Do not change the formatting of imports or existing code unless important for new functionality.
- Preserve existing accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, skip links).
- Maintain SEO optimizations (meta tags, schema.org markup, canonical URLs).

## Code Style and Structure

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer).
- Include proper accessibility attributes (aria-label, aria-expanded, role, etc.).
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces).
- Use descriptive class names with BEM-like conventions when appropriate.
- Include skip links and proper heading hierarchy for accessibility.
- Ensure all images have alt attributes.
- Use proper meta tags for SEO (description, keywords, Open Graph, Twitter cards).

### CSS
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) defined in :root for colors, typography, and spacing.
- Follow the existing CSS organization: reset, variables, base styles, components, utilities.
- Use meaningful class names that describe purpose, not appearance.
- Maintain consistent spacing using the defined spacing variables.
- Use mobile-first responsive design approach.
- Keep CSS organized and maintainable with clear section comments.
- Use efficient selectors and avoid overly specific selectors when possible.

### JavaScript
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
- Wrap code in IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) with 'use strict'.
- Use descriptive function names with verbs (initMobileMenu, showModal, hideModal).
- Prefer function declarations over arrow functions for top-level functions.
- Use event delegation when appropriate for performance.
- Handle edge cases and provide fallbacks for browser compatibility.
- Maintain accessibility features (keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA updates).

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for CSS classes and IDs (e.g., `header-container`, `menu-toggle`).
- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables and functions (e.g., `initMobileMenu`, `isOpen`).
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose (e.g., `skip-link`, `scam-alert-modal`).

## TypeScript/JavaScript Usage
- Use vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features where supported.
- Use const/let instead of var.
- Prefer template literals for string concatenation.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions.
- Use function declarations for named functions.

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use curly braces for all conditionals and loops.
- Favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.
- Use meaningful comments to explain complex logic.
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose.

## Accessibility (a11y)
- Always include proper ARIA attributes.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements.
- Maintain proper focus management in modals and dynamic content.
- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast.
- Include skip links for keyboard users.
- Test with screen readers when adding new interactive elements.

## SEO Best Practices
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3).
- Include meta descriptions and keywords.
- Use semantic HTML structure.
- Include Schema.org structured data where appropriate.
- Ensure all pages have canonical URLs.
- Optimize images with proper alt text and loading attributes.

## Performance Optimization
- Use lazy loading for images.
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript where possible.
- Use efficient selectors.
- Avoid unnecessary DOM queries (cache selectors when reused).
- Use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations when possible.
- Optimize images (appropriate formats, sizes).

## Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers (last 2 versions of major browsers).
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers when necessary (e.g., IntersectionObserver).
- Test responsive design across common device sizes.

## File Organization
- Keep HTML files in root directory.
- Keep CSS in `css/` directory.
- Keep JavaScript in `js/` directory.
- Keep images in `images/` directory.
- Maintain consistent file naming (lowercase with dashes).

## Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code.
- Avoid code duplication; extract reusable patterns.
- Use consistent formatting throughout the project.
- Ensure code is readable and self-documenting.
- Handle errors gracefully.
